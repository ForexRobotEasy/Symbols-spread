## How it works
1. The program includes the necessary libraries for input/output, vector operations, and string manipulation.
2. A structure named `SymbolData` is defined, which stores the parameters of a symbol, such as symbol name, spread, stop level, and limit level.
3. A function named `retrieveSymbolData` is defined to retrieve symbol data from the broker's server and store it in a vector of `SymbolData`.
4. A function named `displaySymbolData` is defined to display the symbol data in a user-friendly format.
5. A function named `calculateSpread` is defined to calculate the spread for each symbol in the vector of `SymbolData`.
6. A function named `filterSymbols` is defined to filter symbols based on a maximum spread and a maximum stop level. Only symbols that meet the criteria are added to a new vector of `SymbolData`.
7. In the `main` function:
   - A vector named `symbols` is initialized to store the symbol data.
   - The `retrieveSymbolData` function is called to retrieve symbol data from the broker's server and store it in the `symbols` vector.
   - The `calculateSpread` function is called to calculate the spread for each symbol in the `symbols` vector.
   - The `displaySymbolData` function is called to display the symbol data in the `symbols` vector.
   - The maximum spread and maximum stop level values are defined.
   - The `filterSymbols` function is called with the maximum spread and maximum stop level values to filter the symbols and store the filtered symbols in a new vector named `filteredSymbols`.
   - The `displaySymbolData` function is called to display the filtered symbol data in the `filteredSymbols` vector.
8. The program ends and returns 0.
